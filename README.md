## Development Process

### 1. **Project Initialization**
- Created with `npx create-next-app@latest --typescript`.
- Set up TypeScript, ESLint, and Prettier for code quality.

### 2. **Global Styles & Theming**
- Defined CSS variables in `globals.css` for colors, backgrounds, and themes.
- Implemented a `ThemeProvider` and `useTheme` hook for theme management.

### 3. **Design System**
- Built reusable components: `Card`, `Button`, `Modal`, `Skeleton`, `ThemeToggle`.
- Ensured all UI uses these shared components for consistency.

### 4. **State Management**
- Used React Context for global state: `TaskContext` and `UserContext`.
- Provided hooks for accessing and updating tasks and user preferences.

### 5. **API & Data**
- Mocked backend with Next.js API routes (`/api/tasks`, `/api/user`).
- Used fetch/async actions for CRUD operations.

### 6. **Pages & Routing**
- Implemented main pages: Dashboard, Tasks, Profile.
- Used dynamic routing for task details (`/tasks/[id]`).

### 7. **SSR & SEO**
- Used server components and server-side data fetching for main pages.
- Added meta tags and Open Graph for SEO.

### 8. **UI/UX Enhancements**
- Added Framer Motion for card, modal, and page animations.
- Implemented skeleton loaders and button spinners for async actions.
- Integrated `react-hot-toast` for notifications.

### 9. **Testing & Quality**
- (Add details if you used unit/integration tests)
- Used Git for version control and clear commit history.

### 10. **Deployment**
- Deployed to Vercel for production hosting.

## Design System & UI/UX

- **Cards:** Used for all major sections (tasks, stats, profile).
- **Buttons:** Primary, secondary, and loading states.
- **Modals:** For editing/adding tasks, animated with Framer Motion.
- **Skeletons:** Shimmer effect for loading states.
- **Theme:** CSS variables and context for light/dark mode.
- **Charts:** Interactive, with tooltips and legends.

---

## State Management

- **TaskContext:** Manages all task data and actions (add, edit, delete, complete).
- **UserContext:** Manages user profile, preferences, and theme.
- **ThemeContext:** Handles theme state and toggle.

---

## API & Data Flow

- **/api/tasks:** GET, POST, PUT, DELETE for tasks.
- **/api/user:** GET, PUT for user profile and preferences.
- **Data Fetching:** Server-side for main pages, client-side for actions.

---

## SSR & SEO

- **Server Components:** Used for main pages for SSR.
- **SEO Tags:** Title, description, Open Graph, and canonical URLs.

---

## Theming

- **ThemeProvider:** Wraps the app, provides theme context.
- **ThemeToggle:** Button to switch between light and dark.
- **CSS Variables:** Used for all colors and backgrounds.

---

## Loading States & Animations

- **Skeletons:** For cards, lists, and charts.
- **Button Spinners:** On form submissions.
- **Framer Motion:** For modals, cards, and page transitions.

---

## Notifications

- **react-hot-toast:** For all user actions (add, edit, delete, save).
- **Consistent feedback:** On both success and error.

---

## Testing & Quality

- **Linting:** ESLint and Prettier for code style.
- **Type Safety:** TypeScript throughout.
- **(Add test details if you have tests)**

---

## Deployment

- **Vercel:** Recommended for Next.js.
- **Production build:** `npm run build` and `npm start`.
